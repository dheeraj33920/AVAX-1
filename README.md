# AVAX-PROOF-Advanced-Avalanche-1

Welcome to the GitHub repository for setting up your own EVM subnet on the Avalanche network and deploying a basic DeFi Kingdom clone. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to enter the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) by creating and deploying essential smart contracts on a custom subnet.

## Project Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn:
- How to set up an EVM subnet on Avalanche.
- How to define a native currency for use within your DeFi Kingdom clone.
- How to connect your subnet to MetaMask.
- How to deploy foundational smart contracts using Solidity and Remix, including an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract.

**Note:** This project focuses on technical setup and deployment. It does not cover the intricacies of DeFi economic models or value generation strategies for users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension for Chrome/Firefox
- [Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/avalanche-evm-subnet-defi-kingdom.git
cd avalanche-evm-subnet-defi-kingdom
```

### 2. Set Up Your EVM Subnet

Follow the detailed guide provided in the `docs/setup_subnet.md` to create your custom EVM subnet on Avalanche.

### 3. Define Your Native Currency

Configure your native currency which will act as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone. Refer to `docs/native_currency.md` for step-by-step instructions.

### 4. Connect to MetaMask

Integrate your subnet with MetaMask using the instructions in `docs/connect_metamask.md` to interact with your deployed contracts.

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contracts

Use the Solidity files located in the `contracts/` directory and deploy them through Remix IDE. Detailed deployment steps can be found in `docs/deploy_contracts.md`.
